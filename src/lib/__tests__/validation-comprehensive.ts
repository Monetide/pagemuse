## Getting Started

Here's what you need to know about using this system:

1. **First step**: Set up your environment
2. **Second step**: Import your documents
3. **Third step**: Verify the parsing results

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js installed (version 16 or higher)
- A modern web browser
- Basic understanding of \`Markdown\` syntax

## Code Examples

### JavaScript Function

\`\`\`javascript
function parseMarkdown(content) {
  const parser = new MarkdownParser();
  return parser.process(content);
}

// Usage example
const result = parseMarkdown('# Hello World');
console.log(result);
\`\`\`

### Python Data Processing

\`\`\`python
def process_documents(files):
    """Process multiple document files"""
    results = []
    for file in files:
        result = parse_file(file)
        results.append(result)
    return results
\`\`\`

### Configuration Example

\`\`\`json
{
  "parser": {
    "format": "commonmark",
    "extensions": ["tables", "strikethrough", "autolink"],
    "options": {
      "breaks": true,

## Quotes and Citations

> The best code is no code at all. The second best is code that is so clear and simple that it is obviously correct.

> Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
> -- Steve Jobs

> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
> -- Harold Abelson

## Callouts and Admonitions

> **Note:** This is an informational callout that provides additional context and helpful tips for users.

> **Warning:** Be extremely careful when modifying production configurations. Always backup your data first.

> **Error:** This represents a critical error condition that must be addressed immediately to prevent system failure.

> **Success:** The operation completed successfully! All tests are passing and the system is ready for deployment.

> **Info:** Here's some additional information that might be useful for understanding the context better.

> **Tip:** Use keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+K to quickly access the command palette and improve your productivity.

## Advanced Formatting

This paragraph contains various formatting options including **bold text**, *italic text*, and \`inline code\`. You can also create [links to external resources](https://example.com "External link title").

### Strikethrough and Special Characters

~~This text has been struck through~~ and replaced with updated information.

Special characters: α β γ δ ε → ← ↑ ↓ ∞ ∑ ∏ ∂ ∇

### Mathematical Expressions

While full LaTeX math isn't supported yet, you can use inline code for simple expressions: \`E = mc²\`, \`x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a\`

## Horizontal Rules and Separators

Content above the first separator.

---

Content between separators.

***

Content below the final separator.

## Mixed Content Example

Here's a complex example that combines multiple elements:

> **Important:** The following code example demonstrates how to integrate multiple data sources.

\`\`\`typescript
interface DataSource {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'api' | 'database' | 'file';
  config: Record<string, any>;
}

class DataIntegrator {
  private sources: DataSource[] = [];
  
  addSource(source: DataSource): void {
    this.sources.push(source);
  }
  
  async processAll(): Promise<ProcessedData[]> {
    const results = await Promise.all(
      this.sources.map(source => this.processSource(source))
    );
    return results.flat();
  }
}
\`\`\`

| Data Source | Processing Time | Success Rate | Error Count |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| User API | 150ms | 99.2% | 3 |
| Orders DB | 85ms | 99.8% | 1 |
| Logs File | 220ms | 97.5% | 12 |

## Conclusion

This comprehensive Markdown document demonstrates all the enhanced parsing capabilities including:

1. ✅ **Headings** (H1-H6) with proper hierarchy
2. ✅ **Text formatting** (bold, italic, inline code, links)
3. ✅ **Lists** (ordered, unordered, nested)
4. ✅ **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting support
5. ✅ **Tables** with headers and alignment
